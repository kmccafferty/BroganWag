BroganWag README

This is my first attempt at a CSS-based animation, featuring my dog, Brógan.
I used illustrator to design Brógan and create 12 different vector images to move his tail.
I then created a sprite-map through Compass and used CSS to animate him!
It's a super simple project and I really enjoyed the process and learning about animations.
